JMini3d
=======
Minimalistic OpenGL2 3d engine for mobile apps that supports Android and GWT (Google Web Toolkit, to create HTML5 apps developing in Java).

HTML5 demo: http://www.mobialia.com/graphics2016-demo-gwt/

It also includes an input abstraction library (with key & pointer events) for Android and GWT.

JMini3d is used in 3d Mobialia games (http://www.mobialia.com) with Android and HTML5 versions like:
* Mobialia Chess: http://chess.mobialia.com http://www.mobialia.com/apps/chess
* Slot Racing: http://slot.mobialia.com http://www.mobialia.com/apps/slot
* Mobialia Four in a Row: http://fourinarow.mobialia.com http://www.mobialia.com/apps/fourinarow

Features
========
* Optimized for speed and smooth rendering
* Extremely fast model loading (converts OBJ models to Java classes)
* Phong lighting model with multiple lights (Ambient/Point/Directional), no attenuation with the distance
* Reflections with cube environment mapping
* HUD and 2d sprites support
* Normal maps
* Vertex colors
* Bitmap font support
* Ready to use in Virtual Reality (VR) projects for Google Cardboard, there is a sample in https://github.com/mobialia/graphics2016-vr-demo

Subprojects
===========
* *core:* includes the common classes between Android and GWT projects
* *android:* the Android library project implementing the OpenGLES 2.0 Renderer, Activity3d, GlSurfaceView3d, etc.
* *gwt:* the GWT library project implementing the WebGL Renderer, EntryPoint3d, Canvas3d, etc. Includes a linker to make JMini3D work with the CocoonJS framework (it can package WebGL apps for iOS)
* *utils:* includes utilities to generate Geometry classes from OBJ models and Font classes from FNT files
* *demo-common:* The common files for the demo project with a SceneController and multiple Scenes
* *demo-android:* The Android demo application
* *demo-gwt:* The demo project in GWT

Axis
====
This library uses by default the same axis system than Blender, Z is up, Y is front. It is right handed.

```
 z   y
 |  /
 | /
 |------x
```
The axis system can be changed to the standard OpenGL system (-Z front, Y up) calling to JMini3d.useOpenglAxisSystem();

HUD Scenes
==========
Jmini3D has a HudCamera and a HudScene to render scenes in 2D with textures as sprites.
There is also a SpriteGeometry and a SpriteMaterial.
The hud scenes may be rendered on top of other 3d scenes.

The coordinates for HUD sprites start in the top left corner with width and height in screen pixels:
```
       x
  0------- width
  |
y |
  |
height
```
When the screen size changes, the Scene is notified with setViewPort(int width, int height) and it must readjust the HUD elements.

Android
=======
To use the library in an Android app you can extend the Activity3d class or use the GlSurfaceView3d.

The image resources must be in the "drawable-nodpi" resource folder.
The ResourceLoader is initialized with a reference to the Android context.

GWT
===
In GWT you must extend the EntryPoint3d or use the Canvas3d wrapper (wraps a DOM canvas element).

The image resources must be in a subfolder of the web project location (src/main/webapp/),
the ResourceLoader is initialized with "./resources/" by default.
The GLSL shaders should be copied manually to a web project folder, "./shaders/" by default.

In mobile devices when using:
```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
```
the canvas must be upscaled by the canvas3d.getDevicePixelRatio(). The scale must be set also in the InputController,
you can see how it works in the demo.

Generate Geometries from OBJ files
==================================
Export to OBJ from Blender (faces must be triangulated and normals outside) with this options:

* Write Normals
* Include UVs
* Triangulate faces
* Y Forward
* Z up

And convert to a Java class with:
```
cd utils
gradle jar
java -cp ./build/libs/graphics2016-utils-0.9.3.jar Obj2Class teapot.obj TeapotGeometry.java graphics2016.demo
```

The generated TeapotGeometry.java is a Java class in the graphics2016.demo package extending Geometry.

Generate Fonts from FNT files
=============================
Jmini3D can use FNT bitmap fonts in text format exported with BMfont http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/ or Littera (online, flash) http://kvazars.com/littera/.
In BMFont export options select "White text with alpha".

To convert the FNT file to a Java class:
```
cd utils
gradle jar
java -cp ./build/libs/graphics2016-utils-0.9.3.jar Fnt2Class arial.fnt ArialFont.java graphics2016.demo
```
The font texture must be placed in the images folder. It supports fonts with only one texture.

Materials and Textures
======================
* A Material can receive a Texture, example:
```
Material m1 = new Material(new Texture("texture.png"));
```
* Textures support PNG and JPEG formats
* A same Texture object can be shared between different materials, and it is uploaded only one time to the GPU
* Material has a setBlending method to enable texture transparency

Build
=====
This project is built with the Gradle build tool, you can download it from http://www.gradle.org

Buld Android demo and install it to the connected device or emulator:
```
cd demo-android
gradle installDebug
```

Build gwt demo in the demo-gwt/src/main/webapp/ directory:
```
cd demo-gwt
gradle compileGwt
```
Then you can start a local Jetty webserver:
```
cd demo-gwt
gradle jettyRun
```
and access with your web browser to http://localhost:8080/graphics2016/

Using JMini3d in other projects
===============================
This library's JARs and AARs are distributed via Mobialia's bintray repo (https://bintray.com/mobialia/maven).
To use them, first include this repository in your gradle file:
```
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://dl.bintray.com/mobialia/maven' }
}
```
and then reference the Jmini3D libraries; example for an Android project:
```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.mobialia:graphics2016-core:0.9.3'
    compile 'com.mobialia:graphics2016-android:0.9.3@aar'
}
```
